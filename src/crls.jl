"""
Solve the linear least-squares problem

    minimize ‖b - Ax‖₂² + λ ‖x‖₂²

using the Conjugate Residuals (CR) method. This method is equivalent to
applying MINRES to the normal equations

    (AᵀA + λI) x = Aᵀb.

This implementation recurs the residual r := b - Ax.

CRLS produces monotonic residuals ‖r‖₂ and optimality residuals ‖Aᵀr‖₂.
It is formally equivalent to LSMR, though can be substantially less accurate,
but simpler to implement.
