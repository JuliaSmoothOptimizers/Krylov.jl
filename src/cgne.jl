`T` is an `AbstractFloat` such as `Float32`, `Float64` or `BigFloat`.
`FC` is `T` or `Complex{T}`.

Solve the consistent linear system

    Ax + √λs = b

of size m × n using the Conjugate Gradient (CG) method, where λ ≥ 0 is a regularization
parameter. This method is equivalent to applying CG to the normal equations
of the second kind

    (AAᴴ + λI) y = b

but is more stable. When λ = 0, this method solves the minimum-norm problem

  min ‖x‖₂  s.t. Ax = b.

When λ > 0, it solves the problem

    min ‖(x,s)‖₂  s.t. Ax + √λs = b.

CGNE produces monotonic errors ‖x-x*‖₂ but not residuals ‖r‖₂.
It is formally equivalent to CRAIG, though can be slightly less accurate,
but simpler to implement. Only the x-part of the solution is returned.

#### Input arguments

* `A`: a linear operator that models a matrix of dimension `m × n`;
* `b`: a vector of length `m`.

#### Keyword arguments

* `N`: linear operator that models a Hermitian positive-definite matrix of size `n` used for preconditioning;
* `ldiv`: define whether the preconditioner uses `ldiv!` or `mul!`;
* `λ`: regularization parameter;
* `atol`: absolute stopping tolerance based on the residual norm;
* `rtol`: relative stopping tolerance based on the residual norm;
* `itmax`: the maximum number of iterations. If `itmax=0`, the default number of iterations is set to `m+n`;
* `timemax`: the time limit in seconds;
* `verbose`: additional details can be displayed if verbose mode is enabled (verbose > 0). Information will be displayed every `verbose` iterations;
* `history`: collect additional statistics on the run such as residual norms, or Aᴴ-residual norms;
* `callback`: function or functor called as `callback(solver)` that returns `true` if the Krylov method should terminate, and `false` otherwise;
* `iostream`: stream to which output is logged.

#### Output arguments

* `x`: a dense vector of length `n`;
* `stats`: statistics collected on the run in a [`SimpleStats`](@ref) structure.
