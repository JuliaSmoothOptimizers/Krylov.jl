"""Solve the consistent linear system

  Ax + √λs = b

using the Conjugate Gradient (CG) method, where λ ≥ 0 is a regularization
parameter. This method is equivalent to applying CG to the normal equations
of the second kind

  (AA' + λI) y = b

but is more stable. When λ = 0, this method solves the minimum-norm problem

  min ‖x‖₂  s.t. Ax = b.

When λ > 0, it solves the problem

  min ‖(x,s)‖₂  s.t. Ax + √λs = b.

CGNE produces monotonic errors ‖x-x*‖₂ but not residuals ‖r‖₂.
It is formally equivalent to CRAIG, though can be slightly less accurate,
but simpler to implement. Only the x-part of the solution is returned.
