"""
Solve the consistent linear system

    Ax + √λs = b

using the Conjugate Residual (CR) method, where λ ≥ 0 is a regularization
parameter. This method is equivalent to applying CR to the normal equations
of the second kind

    (AAᵀ + λI) y = b

but is more stable. When λ = 0, this method solves the minimum-norm problem

    min ‖x‖₂  s.t.  x ∈ argmin ‖Ax - b‖₂.

When λ > 0, this method solves the problem

    min ‖(x,s)‖₂  s.t. Ax + √λs = b.

CGMR produces monotonic residuals ‖r‖₂.
It is formally equivalent to CRAIG-MR, though can be slightly less accurate,
but simpler to implement. Only the x-part of the solution is returned.

A preconditioner M may be provided in the form of a linear operator.
