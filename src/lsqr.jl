Solve the regularized linear least-squares problem

    minimize ‖b - Ax‖₂² + λ² ‖x‖₂²

using the LSQR method, where λ ≥ 0 is a regularization parameter.
LSQR is formally equivalent to applying CG to the normal equations

    (AᵀA + λ² I) x = Aᵀb

(and therefore to CGLS) but is more stable.

LSQR produces monotonic residuals ‖r‖₂ but not optimality residuals ‖Aᵀr‖₂.
It is formally equivalent to CGLS, though can be slightly more accurate.

Preconditioners M and N may be provided in the form of linear operators and are
assumed to be symmetric and positive definite. If `sqd` is set to `true`,
we solve the symmetric and quasi-definite system

    [ E    A ] [ r ]   [ b ]
    [ Aᵀ  -F ] [ x ] = [ 0 ],

where E = M⁻¹  and F = N⁻¹.

If `sqd` is set to `false` (the default), we solve the symmetric and
indefinite system

    [ E    A ] [ r ]   [ b ]
    [ Aᵀ   0 ] [ x ] = [ 0 ].

In this case, `N` can still be specified and indicates the norm
in which `x` should be measured.
