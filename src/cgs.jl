Solve the consistent linear system Ax = b using conjugate gradient squared algorithm.

From "Iterative Methods for Sparse Linear Systems (Y. Saad)" :

«The method is based on a polynomial variant of the conjugate gradients algorithm.
Although related to the so-called bi-conjugate gradients (BCG) algorithm,
it does not involve adjoint matrix-vector multiplications, and the expected convergence
rate is about twice that of the BCG algorithm.

The Conjugate Gradient Squared algorithm works quite well in many cases.
However, one difficulty is that, since the polynomials are squared, rounding errors
tend to be more damaging than in the standard BCG algorithm. In particular, very
high variations of the residual vectors often cause the residual norms computed
to become inaccurate.

TFQMR and BICGSTAB were developed to remedy this difficulty.»

This implementation allows a right preconditioner M.
