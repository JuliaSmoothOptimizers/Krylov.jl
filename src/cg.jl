# A standard implementation of the Conjugate Gradient method.
# The only non-standard point about it is that it does not check
# that the operator is definite.
# It is possible to check that the system is inconsistent by
# monitoring ‖p‖, which would cost an extra norm computation per
# iteration.

"""
The conjugate gradient method to solve the symmetric linear system Ax=b.

The method does _not_ abort if A is not definite.

A preconditioner M may be provided in the form of a linear operator and is
assumed to be symmetric and positive definite.
M also indicates the weighted norm in which residuals are measured.
