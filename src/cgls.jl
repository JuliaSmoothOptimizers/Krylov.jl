# equivalently, of the normal equations
#
#  A'Ax = A'b.
#
# CGLS is formally equivalent to applying the conjugate gradient method
# to the normal equations but should be more stable. It is also formally
# equivalent to LSQR though LSQR should be expected to be more stable on
# ill-conditioned or poorly scaled problems.
#
# This implementation is the standard formulation, as recommended by
# A. Björck, T. Elfving and Z. Strakos, Stability of Conjugate Gradient
# and Lanczos Methods for Linear Least Squares Problems.

"""Solve the regularized linear least-squares problem

  minimize ‖b - Ax‖₂² + λ ‖x‖₂²

using the Conjugate Gradient (CG) method, where λ ≥ 0 is a regularization
parameter. This method is equivalent to applying CG to the normal equations

  (A'A + λI) x = A'b

but is more stable.

CGLS produces monotonic residuals ‖r‖₂ but not optimality residuals ‖A'r‖₂.
It is formally equivalent to LSQR, though can be slightly less accurate,
but simpler to implement.
