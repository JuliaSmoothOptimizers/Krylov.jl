# Summary

[Krylov.jl](https://github.com/JuliaSmoothOptimizers/Krylov.jl) is a Julia [@bezanson-edelman-karpinski-shah-2017] package that implements a collection of Krylov processes and methods for solving a variety of linear problems:

|  Square systems | Linear least-squares problems | Linear least-norm problems              |
|:---------------:|:-----------------------------:| :--------------------------------------:|
| $Ax = b$        | $\min \|b - Ax\|$             | $\min \|x\|~~\text{subject to}~~Ax = b$ |

\vspace{-0.85cm}

| Adjoint systems | Saddle-point and Hermitian quasi-definite systems | Generalized saddle-point and non-Hermitian partitioned systems |
|:---------------:|:-------------------------------------------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------:|
|$\begin{matrix} Ax = b \\ A^{H\!} y = c \end{matrix}$ | $\begin{bmatrix} M & \!\phantom{-}A \\ A^{
  H\!} & \!-N \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} b \\ c \end{bmatrix}$ | $\begin{bmatrix} M & A \\ B & N \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} b \\ c \end{bmatrix}$ |

$A^{H\!}$ denotes the conjugate transpose of $A$.
It coincides with $A^{T\!}$, the transpose of $A$, if $A$ is real.
Krylov methods are iterative methods based on @krylov-1931 subspaces.
They are an alternative to direct methods such as Gaussian elimination or QR decomposition when storage requirements or computational costs become prohibitive, which is often the case for large and sparse linear systems.
Contrary to direct methods, which require storing $A$ explicitly, Krylov methods support linear operators to model operator-vector products $u \leftarrow Av$, and in some instances $u \leftarrow A^{H\!}w$ because Krylov processes only require those operations to build Krylov subspaces.
The same goes with preconditioners, i.e., transformations that modify a linear system into an equivalent form with favorable spectral properties that may yield faster convergence in finite-precision arithmetic.
We refer interested readers to [@ipsen-meyer-1998] for an introduction to Krylov methods along with [@greenbaum-1997] and [@saad-2003] for more details.

# Features and Functionalities

##  Largest collection of Krylov processes and methods

Krylov.jl aims to provide a unified interface for the largest collection of Krylov processes and methods, all programming languages taken together, with six and thirty-three implementations, respectively:

- \textbf{Krylov processes}: \textsc{Arnoldi}, \textsc{Golub-Kahan}, \textsc{Hermitian Lanczos}, \textsc{Montoison-Orban}, \textsc{Non-Hermitian Lanczos},  \textsc{Saunders-Simon-Yip};
- \textbf{Krylov methods}: \textsc{Bicgstab}, \textsc{Bilq}, \textsc{Bilqr}, \textsc{Cg}, \textsc{Cg-lanczos}, \textsc{Cg-lanczos-shift}, \textsc{Cgls}, \textsc{Cgne}, \textsc{Cgs}, \textsc{Cr}, \textsc{Craig}, \textsc{Craigmr}, \textsc{Crls}, \textsc{Crmr}, \textsc{Diom}, \textsc{Dqgmres}, \textsc{Fgmres}, \textsc{Fom}, \textsc{Gmres}, \textsc{Gpmr}, \textsc{Lnlq}, \textsc{Lslq}, \textsc{Lsmr}, \textsc{Lsqr}, \textsc{Minres}, \textsc{Minres-qlp}, \textsc{Qmr}, \textsc{Symmlq}, \textsc{Tricg}, \textsc{Trilqr}, \textsc{Trimr}, \textsc{Usymlq}, \textsc{Usymqr}.

Some processes and methods are not available elsewhere and are the product of our own research.
References for each process and method are available in the extensive [documentation](https://juliasmoothoptimizers.github.io/Krylov.jl/stable/).

## Support for any floating-point system supported by Julia

Krylov.jl works with real and complex data in any floating-point system supported by Julia, which means that Krylov.jl handles any precision `T` and `Complex{T}` where `T <: AbstractFloat`.
Although most personal computers offer IEEE 754 single and double precision computations, new architectures implement native computations in other floating-point systems.
In addition, software libraries such as the GNU MPFR, shipped with Julia, let users experiment with computations in variable, extended precision at the software level with the `BigFloat` data type.
Working in high precision has obvious benefits in terms of accuracy.
<!-- We can solve linear systems within the common half, single, double and arbitrary precision (`Float16`, `Float32`, `Float64`, `BigFloat` and their complex counterparts) but shipped with Julia or additional precision implemented through packages. -->
<!-- The alternative half precision format `BFloat16` provided by [BFloat16s.jl](https://github.com/JuliaMath/BFloat16s.jl) or the quadruple precision `Float128` implemented in [Quadmath.jl](https://github.com/JuliaMath/Quadmath.jl) are supported by Krylov.jl for instance. -->
<!-- DoubleFloats.jl, AbNumerics.jl, DecFP.jl, MultiFloats.jl... -->

## Support for Nvidia, AMD and Intel GPUs

Krylov methods are well suited for GPU computations because they only require operator-vector products ($u \leftarrow Av$, $u \leftarrow A^{H\!}w$) and vector operations ($\|v\|$, $u^H v$, $v \leftarrow \alpha u + \beta v$), which are highly parallelizable.
The implementations in Krylov.jl are generic so as to take advantage of the multiple dispatch and broadcast features of Julia.
Those allow the implementations to be specialized automatically by the compiler for both CPU and GPU.
Thus, Krylov.jl works with GPU backends that build on [GPUArrays.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/GPUArrays.jl), including [CUDA.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/CUDA.jl), [AMDGPU.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/AMDGPU.jl) and [oneAPI.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/oneAPI.jl), the Julia interfaces to Nvidia, AMD and Intel GPUs.
<!-- Our implementations target the CUDA, ROCm or OneAPI libraries for efficient operator-vector products and vector operations on Nvidia, AMD and Intel GPUs. -->

## Support for linear operators

The input arguments of all Krylov.jl solvers that model $A$, $B$, $M$, $N$ and preconditioners can be any object that represents a linear operator.
Krylov methods combined with linear operators allow to reduce computation time and memory requirements considerably by avoiding building and storing the system matrix.
In nonlinear optimization, finding a critical point of a continuous function frequently involves linear systems where $A$ is a Hessian or a Jacobian.
Materializing such operators as matrices is expensive in terms of operations and memory consumption and is unreasonable for high-dimensional problems.
However, it is often possible to implement efficient Hessian-vector and Jacobian-vector products, for example with the help of automatic differentiation tools.

## In-place methods

All solvers in Krylov.jl have an in-place variant that allows to solve multiple linear systems with the same dimensions, precision and architecture.
Optimization methods such as the Newton and Gauss-Newton methods can take advantage of this functionality by allocating workspace for the solve only once.
The in-place variants only require a Julia structure that contains all the storage needed by a Krylov method as additional argument.
In-place methods limit memory allocations and deallocations, which are particularly expensive on GPUs.

## Performance optimizations and storage requirements

Operator-vector products and vector operations are the most expensive operations in Krylov.jl.
We rely on BLAS routines as much as possible to perform those operations.
By default, Julia ships with OpenBLAS and provides multithreaded routines.
Since Julia 1.6, users can also switch dynamically to other BLAS backends, such as Apple Accelerate, the Intel MKL or BLIS, thanks to the BLAS demuxing library `libblastrampoline`, if an optimized BLAS is available.
<!-- une petite transition ne serait pas du luxe -->

A ``Storage Requirements'' section is available in the documentation to provide the theoretical number of bits required by each method.
Our implementations are storage-optimal in the sense that they are guaranteed to match the theoretical storage amount.
The match is verified in the unit tests by way of functions that return the number of bits allocated by our implementations.

# Examples

Our first example is a simple implementation of Newton's method without linesearch for convex optimization.
It illustrates several of the facilities of Krylov.jl: solver preallocation and reuse, genericity with respect to data types, and linear operators.
Because we expect the Hessian to be symmetric and positive definite, we use the conjugate gradient method.
However, other methods for symmetric systems could be used, including CR and MINRES.

using MKL              # Intel BLAS
using CUDA             # Interface to Nvidia GPUs
using CUDA.CUSPARSE    # Nvidia CUSPARSE library
```

<!-- At each iteration of Newton's method applied to a $\mathcal{C}^2$ strictly convex function $f : \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, a descent direction direction is determined by minimizing the quadratic Taylor model of $f$:
$$\min_{d \in \mathbb{R}^n}~~f(x_k) + \nabla f(x_k)^T d + \tfrac{1}{2}~d^T \nabla^2 f(x_k) d$$
which is equivalent to solving the symmetric and positive-definite system
$$\nabla^2 f(x_k) d  = -\nabla f(x_k).$$
The system above can be solved with the conjugate gradient method. -->

```julia
"The Newton method for convex optimization"
function newton(‚àáf, ‚àá¬≤f, x‚ÇÄ::AbstractVector{T}; itmax = 200, tol = ‚àöeps(T)) where T
    n = length(x‚ÇÄ)
    x = copy(x‚ÇÄ)
    gx = ‚àáf(x)
    iter = 0
    S = typeof(x)               # precision and architecture

        cg!(solver, Hx, -gx)  # Solve ‚àá¬≤f(x‚Çñ)Œîx = -‚àáf(x‚Çñ)
        x .+= solver.x        # Update x‚Çñ‚Çä‚ÇÅ = x‚Çñ + Œîx
        gx = ‚àáf(x)            # ‚àáf(x‚Çñ‚Çä‚ÇÅ)
        iter += 1
        solved = norm(gx) ‚â§ tol
        tired = iter ‚â• itmax
    end
    return x
end

T = Float16  # IEEE half precision
n = 4
x‚ÇÄ = -ones(T, n)
f(x) = sum((x[i] - i)^2 for i = 1:n)                                # f(x)
‚àáf(x) = ForwardDiff.gradient(f, x)                                  # ‚àáf(x)
H(y, x, v) = ForwardDiff.derivative!(y, t -> ‚àáf(x + t * v), 0)      # y ‚Üê ‚àá¬≤f(x)v

‚àá¬≤f(x) = LinearOperator(T, n, n, symmetric, hermitian, (y, v) -> H(y, x, v))  # ‚àá¬≤f(x)
newton(‚àáf, ‚àá¬≤f, x‚ÇÄ)
```

Our second example illustrates similar concepts with a solver for rectangular problems, in this case a linear least-squares solver, in the context of a simplistic Gauss-Newton method without linesearch for nonlinear least squares.

<!-- At each iteration of the Gauss-Newton method applied to a nonlinear least-squares objective $f(x) = \tfrac{1}{2}\| F(x)\|^2$ where $F : \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$ is $\mathcal{C}^1$, we solve the subproblem:
$$\min_{d \in \mathbb{R}^n}~~\tfrac{1}{2}~\|J(x_k) d + F(x_k)\|^2,$$
where $J(x)$ is the Jacobian of $F$ at $x$.
An appropriate iterative method to solve the above linear least-squares problems is LSMR. -->

```julia
"The Gauss-Newton method for Nonlinear Least Squares"
function gauss_newton(F, JF, x‚ÇÄ; itmax = 200, tol = 1e-8)
    n = length(x‚ÇÄ)
    x = copy(x‚ÇÄ)
    Fx = F(x)
    m = length(Fx)
    iter = 0
    S = typeof(x)                 # precision and architecture
    solver = LsmrSolver(m, n, S)  # structure that contains the workspace of LSMR
    solved = tired = false
    while !(solved || tired)
        Jx = JF(x)              # Compute J(x‚Çñ)
        lsmr!(solver, Jx, -Fx)  # Minimize ‚ÄñJ(x‚Çñ)Œîx + F(x‚Çñ)‚Äñ
        x .+= Œîx                # Update x‚Çñ‚Çä‚ÇÅ = x‚Çñ + Œîx
        Fx_old = Fx             # F(x‚Çñ)
        Fx = F(x)               # F(x‚Çñ‚Çä‚ÇÅ)
        iter += 1
        solved = norm(Fx - Fx_old) / norm(Fx) ‚â§ tol
        tired = iter ‚â• itmax
    end
    return x
end

T = Float128  # IEEE quadruple precision
x‚ÇÄ = ones(T, 2)
F(x) = [x[1]^4 - 3; exp(x[2]) - 2; log(x[1]) - x[2]^2]         # F(x)
J(y, x, v) = ForwardDiff.derivative!(y, t -> F(x + t * v), 0)  # y ‚Üê JF(x)v
J·µÄ(y, x, w) = ForwardDiff.gradient!(y, x -> dot(F(x), w), x)   # y ‚Üê JF·µÄ(x)w
symmetric = hermitian = false
JF(x) = LinearOperator(T, 3, 2, symmetric, hermitian, (y, v) -> J(y, x, v),   # non-transpose
                                                      (y, w) -> J·µÄ(y, x, w),  # transpose
                                                      (y, w) -> J·µÄ(y, x, w))  # conjugate transpose
gauss_newton(F, JF, x‚ÇÄ)
```

Our final example concerns the solution of a set of complex normal equations with incomplete Cholesky preconditioner on GPU.
The preconditioner $P$ is implemented as an in-place linear operator that performs the forward and backward sweeps with the Cholesky factor to model $P^{-1}$.

```julia
A_cpu = sprand(ComplexF64, 100, 100, 0.05)
A_cpu = A_cpu * A_cpu'
b_cpu = rand(ComplexF64, 100)

# Transfer the linear system from the CPU to the GPU
A_gpu = CuSparseMatrixCSR(A_cpu)
b_gpu = CuVector(b_cpu)

# Incomplete Cholesky decomposition LL·¥¥ ‚âà A with zero fill-in
P = ic02(A_gpu, 'O')

# Solve Py = x
function ldiv_ic0!(y, P, x)
  copyto!(y, x)
  ldiv!(LowerTriangular(P), y)   # Forward substitution with L
  ldiv!(LowerTriangular(P'), y)  # Backward substitution with L·¥¥
  return y
end

# Linear operator that model the preconditioner P‚Åª¬π
n = length(b_gpu)
T = eltype(b_gpu)
symmetric = false
hermitian = true
P‚Åª¬π = LinearOperator(T, n, n, symmetric, hermitian, (y, x) -> ldiv_ic0!(y, P, x))

# Solve a Hermitian positive definite system with an incomplete Cholesky preconditioner on GPU
x, stats = minres(A_gpu, b_gpu, M=P‚Åª¬π)
```
