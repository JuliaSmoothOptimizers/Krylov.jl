# TODO List

## Methods

- [X] CG
- [X] CRLS: CR on A'Ax = A'b (equivalent to LSMR in exact arithmetic)
- [ ] LSQR (equivalent to CG on A'Ax = A'b)
- [ ] LSMR (equivalent to MINRES on A'Ax = A'b)
- [ ] MINRES
- [ ] CRAIG (equivalent to CG on AA'y=b, x = A'y)
- [ ] CRAIGMR (must be equivalent to CR on AA'y = b, x = A'y)

## Special features

- [ ] Estimate norms and conditions numbers
- [X] Allow for regularization
- [X] Allow for shifts
